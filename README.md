## What does this do?
This is a simple command line tool that reads entity data from a Super Mario Maker 2 course file.

## What do I need to set this tool up?
[This package](https://github.com/MarioPossamato/smm2bcd/archive/master.zip)  
[Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/)  
[Simontime's Super Mario Maker 2 Course Decryptor](https://github.com/simontime/SMM2CourseDecryptor/releases)

## What are the path.txt files for in the paths folder?
They are text files that contain placeholder text.  All of the 'Open Course' functions use the decryptor_path file, and the `import_enc_course_path()` and `import_dec_course_path()` use the `enc_course_path.txt` and `enc_course_path.txt` files for conveience.

## How do I run this tool?
Before you start, make sure the `dec_path.txt` file contains the path of the course decryptor executable above...  
On Windows, just double-click the batch script included in the package;  
On Linux, open the console and type `wine cmd.exe /c` followed by the path of the batch script.
